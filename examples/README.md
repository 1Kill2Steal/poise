Here is a curated list of examples that thrive to demonstrate the capabilities of `poise` and how its features are meant to be used.

To be able to run examples you must enable `serenity`'s `collector` feature. Thus if you want to run the `framework_usage` example, run: `cargo run --example=framework_usage --features collector`.

You must also set the following environment variables:
- `TOKEN`: your application's token

Application ID and owner ID don't have to be set, since they are requested from Discord on startup
by poise.
